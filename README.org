#+TITLE: A Basic Emacs Configuration for Engineers

This is a basic config file I'm creating to make it easy to start with emacs.
It's actually a little more than just "basic". It should have most of the immediate needs for usage.

* Instructions
1. Ensure you have the latest emacs installed.
2. Install some utilities for pdfs through
   #+begin_src bash
     # Almalinux
     yum install autoconf automake gcc libpng-devel make pkgconfig poppler-devel poppler-glib-devel zlib-devel

     # Ubuntu
     apt install autoconf automake gcc libpng-devel make pkgconfig poppler-devel poppler-glib-devel zlib-devel
   #+end_src
3. Create a directory called "org-roam" in your home.
   #+begin_src bash
     mkdir ~/org-roam
   #+end_src
4. Clone the contents of this repository into your ~/.emacs.d folder.
5. Fire up emacs 2-3 times to ensure everything is installed properly
